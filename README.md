# Randomized greedy algorithm
This repository contains the student project that has been created for the purpose of Scientific Computing course on the master studies at the Faculty of Mathematics, University of Belgrade.

# About the project
In this project we have tried to implement every algorithm that is mentioned and described in the "Cluster Cores and Modularity Maximization" research paper written by Michael Ovelgonne and Andreas Geyer-Schulz. Those algorithms are: plain greedy algorithm, randomized greedy algorithm and the fast randomized greedy algorithm. We have also implemented some terms and definitions that are used for validating the quality of graph clustering like modularity function.

# Files and folders within repository
The repository consist of the following items. Every single one of them will be listed and briefly explained below:

- Instances - a folder that contains graph instances with which we were working with;

- Scripts - a folder that contains two short Python scripts that actually represent unoptimized implementation of plain greedy and randomized greedy algorithm; 
  
- randomized_greedy_algorithm.ipynb - the most important file in the repository. It contains short explanation and implementation of the algorithms mentioned in the research paper we refer to in previous section; 

- notes.md - just a file from which we generate output.pdf file;
  
- output.pdf - a file that contains all of our understandings of the things discussed in the paper.
