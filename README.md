# Randomized Greedy Algorithm for Graph Clustering

This repository contains a student project developed as part of the **Scientific Computing** course in the master's program at the **Faculty of Mathematics, University of Belgrade**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to implement and experiment with clustering algorithms discussed in the research paper:

> **"Cluster Cores and Modularity Maximization"**  
> *Michael Ovelgönne & Andreas Geyer-Schulz*  
> [IEEE Link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5693431)

Implemented algorithms include:
- **Plain Greedy Algorithm**
- **Randomized Greedy Algorithm**
- **Fast Randomized Greedy Algorithm**

Additionally, we’ve implemented relevant concepts like **modularity**, which is used to evaluate the quality of graph clustering.
