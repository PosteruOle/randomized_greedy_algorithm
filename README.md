# Randomized greedy algorithm
This repository contains the student project that has been created for the purpose of Scientific Computing course on the master studies at the Faculty of Mathematics, University of Belgrade.

# About the project
In this project we have tried to implement every algorithm that is mentioned and described in the "Cluster Cores and Modularity Maximization" research paper written by Michael Ovelgonne and Andreas Geyer-Schulz. Those algorithms are: plain greedy algorithm, randomized greedy algorithm and the fast randomized greedy algorithm. We have also implemented some terms and definitions that are used for validating the quality of graph clustering like modularity function.
